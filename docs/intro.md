# Introduction

Slipway lets you quickly create custom dashboards (called Rigs) that can be displayed
on almost any device with a display.
For a quick overview of what Slipway is for, and how it works at a high level, see our [landing page](/).

If you're ready to get started creating your own Rigs and Components, then keep reading to find out
how it all works.

- The [Getting Started](/docs/category/getting-started) section tells you
[how to install Slipway](/docs/getting-started/installing-slipway),
and runs you though [creating your first Component and Rig](/docs/getting-started/create-your-first-rig).
It's a great way to quickly get an idea of how Slipway works in more detail.

- The [Basics](/docs/category/basics) section then takes you through everything you need to know
to start producing useful, powerful Rigs, and how to run them and host them for your devices.

- The [Guides](/docs/category/guides) section is a collection of useful docs on everything from debugging rigs
to hosting on common providers to creating custom component registries.

- The [Advanced Guides](/docs/category/advanced-guides) section gets into the weeds of Rigs and Components.

For using Rigs with specific devices we provide the following:

- [Using with TRMNL Devices](/docs/using-with-trmnl/slipway-for-trmnl-devices)

- Using with iOS Widgets (Coming soon)
