# Introduction

Slipway lets you quickly create custom dashboards (called Rigs) that can be displayed
on almost any device with a display.[^1]

If you have data in one place and want to display it in another place, Slipway is designed to do that with
minimum fuss and minimum code.

You can often create these Rigs with just some simple JSON configuration, but if more custom work is required
then it often only needs a small amount of code, written in a language of your choice.[^2]

This is possible because Slipway leans on an ecosystem of components that take care
of the complicated, repetitive, or boring tasks. This leaves you to focus only on the code
or configuration which is specific to your scenario.

Next we'll talk about how this all works.


[^1]: For example: On an eInk screen in your house, on your phone as a widget, on a mission control style monitor wall,
or even in AR when you look things in your house. Basically anything that can display either
an image or a web page can display a Slipway Rig.

[^2]: Slipway currently supports Javascript or any language that compiles to WASM, such as Rust.
