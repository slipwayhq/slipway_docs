# Hosting

We don't currently offer hosting, although we've made it as [simple as possible to self-host](/docs/guides/hosting-on-fly).

In the future we hope to offer hosting for those who want the simplest possible way to run Slipway.
This will exist alongside the existing self-hosting options.

If this interests you, please [let us know](/community).
